# Exercise: lists 2
* define a testing class with a `main()` method where you:
    * define a `List` of integers called `divisorsOf52` that contains [all the divisors](https://onlinemathtools.com/find-all-divisors) of 52
    * define a `List` of integers called `randomNumbers` that contains the following numbers: `1, 60, 13, 12`
    * use a specific method of `List` for appending all the elements of `divisorsOf52` at the bottom of `randomNumbers`
    * print the elements of `randomNumbers` and the number of items inside `randomNumbers`
    * find the positions of the duplicates and remove them, leaving just 1 occurrence of a specific integer
    * print again the elements of `randomNumbers` and the number of items inside `randomNumbers`
    * sort `randomNumbers` in descending order using `Collections.sort()`
    * print again the elements of `randomNumbers`
